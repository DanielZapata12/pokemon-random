# Pokemon Random


A simple project I decided to create to help fuel <a href="https://github.com/Wonder-Toast/pokebot">PokeBot</a> and also for users to use and enjoy!


**Getting Started** 
To install, simply run the following command in your terminal (from your project directory):
```
npm install pokemon-random --save

```
