A simple project I decided to create to help fuel <a href="https://github.com/Wonder-Toast/pokebot">PokeBot</a> and also for users to use and enjoy!




**Getting Started** 

To install, simply run the following command in your terminal (from your project directory):

```

npm install pokemon-random --save


```
